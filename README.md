# Text Adventure Commands
Half april fool's joke, half mod jam entry.  All me not knowing what I'm doing.

Text Adventure Commands adds a whole new way to play Minecraft.  Take your gaming into the first dimension with pure text gameplay!  A bold new adventures awaits you.

Text Adventure Commands was made by FeyberryJam in like 2 days when someone told me about Modjam.  I've never really used github before and don't know what I'm doing.  Apparently it's a required part of Modjam.

Text Adventure Commands has a really awesome license that it's under.  You just don't know it, it's from Canada.  GNU General Public, maybe?  I'll research it more later I guess >.<

I'll try to fix the problems with this submission later :X

Once the mod is installed, you can type /textadventure for some helpful information.  That's all, good bye!
