# Text Adventure Commands

Text Adventure Commands adds a whole new way to play Minecraft.  Take your gaming into the first dimension with pure text gameplay!  A bold new experience awaits you.

Once the mod is installed, you can type /textadventure for some helpful information.  If you only want to spend a few minutes checking out the mod I'd recommend finding a village in the rain and throw some stuff on the ground, so you have some creatures and items to interact with. 

Text Adventure Commands was made by FeyberryJam in like 2 days after I heard Modjam was a thing.  I haven't touched Java in nearly 2 years and I'm sort of new to github, licenses, sharing code, etc.  Please be kind to me.

The registration for Modjam asked me to include a license so I slapped on some kind of GNU General Public license.  Just, you know, "OC PLEASE DO NOT STEAL" and we're cool.

You can find my mod ready to use (hopefully) here in my dropbox:

There's a lot more I'd like to do with this mod concept, if anyone shows interest.  Otherwise this is probably the final version!

Thanks for looking!
Lot's of love, FeyberryJam
